# QA-MonkeyTesting
QA monkey testing with Gremlins JS for artistic purposes.

Gremlins monkey testing is a way of testing that creates random user input, such as clicks and swipes, with the single purpose of seeking issues. There is less control for developers about the execution of a monkey test, because they are random every time they are run.
